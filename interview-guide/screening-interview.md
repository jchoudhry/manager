# Screening

Reflecting on my interview with UTC dX, I felt like the eteki interview was not a valuable portion of the assessment, both for dX and myself as a candidate. Below is my reasoning -

-   The interviewer contracted by eteki is not part of UTC dX and does reflect our culture.
-   The interview did not assess my technical ability. I wrote ~10 lines of code and answered very basic programming questions.
-   Given the dX team in an innovation team, it did not assess my interest in learning and adapting to new technologies.

My suggestion would be to have UTC dX associates do 20-30 minute phone screens including coder pad.

_TODO Finish_
