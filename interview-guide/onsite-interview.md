# Onsite Interviews

Onsite interviews, also known as powerdays, would consist of **multiple 45 minute interviews**. Each interview conducted would be one of two types - **behavioral** or **job fit**.

### Behavioral Interview

The purpose of the Behavioral interview is to determine if a candidate:

-   Is a culture fit to our organization
-   Possesses the qualities of an ideal team player: [hungry, humble and smart](/assets/IdealTeamPlayerHowtoSpot.pdf)
-   Meets [UTC's Competencies and Behavioral Indicators](/assets/UTC%20Competencies.pdf)

This interview would consist of **three** questions from the [Behavioral Interview Questions List](/interview-questions/behavioral.md) chosen by the panelist prior to the interview.

### Job Fit Interview

The purpose of the Job Fit interview is to determine if a candidate possess the technical knowledge, skills and experience for the specific role. It could also asses problem structuring, creativity and business senses, as well as communication.

Panelists should design questions prior to the interview considering:

1.  The variety and depth of experience the candidate brings forth in the interview process, such as on their resume
2.  The requirements of the role the candidate is being assessed for

Questions can be taken from the [Job Fit Interview Questions](/interview-questions/job-fit.md). If the panelist(s) conducting the Job Fit interview is not a member of the team the candidate is interviewing for, they should and are expected to consult the hiring manager prior.

### Consensus

The goal for the panelists is to provide a recommendation and a case to the hiring manager. In conensus, each panelist should be prepared to discuss each question asked and the canidate's response.

### Notes

For each 45 minute interview, one or two panelists will participate in assessing the candidate. No greater than two panelists should be present in any interview to foster a positive interview experience for the candidate.

For compliance reasons, the format or structure of the powerday must be consistent for all applicants under the same requistion. For instance, if Alice was a candidate for `ReqID C123 - Senior Software Engineer` and was given 2 Behavioral interviews, and 2 Job Fit interviews, then Bob who is being evaluated for the same requistion should also be administered 2 Behavioral interviews and 2 Job Fit interviews. The questions given during in each interview and panelists can vary.
