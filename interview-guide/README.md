### Preface

From my experience in recruiting and interviewing at Capital One Labs, I've created an interview guide including questions to enhance our procedures in assessing candidates for technical roles at the Digital Accelerator.

Creating an interview guide and streamlining the process entails collaboration. My suggestion would be to move this repository to the [UTDX organization](https://github.dx.utc.com/utdx) and encourage team members to contribute their interview questions and opportunities for enhancement via pull requests. Others including our engineering and recruiting leadership could then offer their opinion and sign off to suggestions.

# DX Interview Guide

### Mission

By having an established interview guide and standards agreed upon by all in the hiring process, we can enable the interview panelists at the Digital Accelerator to:

1.  Create an accurate assessment of candidates to ensure our bar for talent remains high
2.  Provide a stronger advocation to hiring managers during consensus
3.  Offer a more positive interview experience to candidates and conceivably increase the pipeline of applicants
